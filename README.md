# Space Launch React App

This project is a React-based web application (technical task fro CTHINGS.CO)

Preview: [modal-test-work.vercel.app](https://modal-test-work.vercel.app/))

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

`Typescript`
`React`
`React Query`
`SCSS`

## Timing
If I had more time, I would devote my attention to improving the next points:
- Detailed work with styles (putting variables in a separate file, more detailed fitting by styles)
- Working with React Query states (isLoading)
- Adding validation to the number entry field (character limit, adding "-" stylisation)
- Handling events when an input is not filled (message output for the user)
- Moving smaller re-usable pieces into separate components
- More detailed work with types
- Custom scrollbar styling
- Moving interfaces to separate files

## Install dependencies with npm install
Start the application with **npm start**
